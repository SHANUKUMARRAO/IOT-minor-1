# Topic::-- Security Mechanisms in 6LoWPAN

Discription::
‚¶Å	6LoWPAN is the fundamental part of IOT , its security mechanism is very important part.The 6LoWPAN concept originated from the idea that "the Internet Protocol could and should be applied even to the smallest devices,".and that low-power devices with limited processing capabilities should be able to participate in the Internet of Things.That's why it is important to secure.
